You want to link your Atari (Mega) ST/TT/STE/Falcon/Milan to an
ethernet network and are looking for hardware and software? Here is
another solution!

ETHERNE
	ETHERnet with NE2000 hardware

Prerequisites: 

- An Atari ST/TT/Falcon compatible machine with either Cartridge Port
  (ROM port) or ACSI-port
  or
  A Milan machine with ISA slots

- STing or MagiCNet or MINTNet networking software

- A standard NE2000 or NE1000 network card for the ISA bus as is used
  with PCs

Please see file ETHERNE.TXT for a description of the software, how to
select hardware where to obtain adapter hardware and software
installation.

File HARDWARE.TXT contains functional descriptions of the hardware
solutions.

The Directory SRC contains the complete source code. File ARCHITEC.TXT
contains a guide to the driver software architecture and software
specifics. File HW-TEST.TXT explains about software to test various
aspects of the EtherNE hardware adapters.

This package contains a set of hardware circuit schematics and driver
software including source code. *Both* can be used under the GNU
Public License. Please do read file COPYING.TXT.

I want to encourage people to build the adapter hardware and also sell
it to others. The complete documentation however shall be Open Source
under GNU GPL.
If somebody comes up with a CAD version of the hardware circuit
schematics, I require it be published also under GNU public license in
order to make it even easier for people to build the adapter. That
documentation shall become part of future versions of the ETHERNE
package.

All images are 360 DPI.  They are not mirrored, as viewed from 
my CAD software.

The adaptor is double side adap_ss.gif and adap_cs.gif  
The actual board is single sided, soldside.gif with links on 
top as shown in links.gif

I have tested both an 74LS245 and 74HTC245, both work fine, although 
I'd favour the latter.

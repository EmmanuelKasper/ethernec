Testing EtherNE hardware

There are two small TOS programs to test the EtherNE basic hardware
function. Both are meant to be run *without* NE2000 card in the
adapter:

- HT1ENE*.TOS (see also source HT1ENE.S)

The * stands for "C", "AF" or "AS" depending on the adapter hardware.
C:	EtherNEC ROM port adapter
AF:	EtherNEA ACSI port adapter, fast setting
AS:	EtherNEA ACSI port adapter, slow setting

This just reads in a loop from the ISA bus and prints what was being
read until you hit any key. If you short in turn with a diode from ISA
/IOR (kathode) an ISA data line (anode) you should see this bit
toggle. Without short read-out shall be $ff because all data lines 
are open.
Read-out should be $fe if D0 gets shorted, $fd if D1 and so on.


- HT4ENEC.TOS (see also source HT4ENEC.S)

This test only applies to EtherNEC. It also tests the data lines but
exploits the fact that data to be written to the ISA bus get also read
back by the processor. This is by design of the EtherNEC adapter and
the fact that "writing" to the ROM port has to be simulated by reads.
Thus a roundtrip test can be done. Just run it and see if data read
match data written.


Obviously the tests HT4ENEC.TOS and HT1ENEC.TOS overlap somewhat in
test coverage but they provide an end-to-end test for the data bus.

I am afraid there is nothing as easy with the ISA address lines.
I tested them with HT1ENE.S with different conditional assembly
paths and with a oscilloscope.


If tests above were successful there is a first test *with* the NE2000
card fitted.

- HT2ENE.TOS (see also source HT2ENE.S)

This software resets and initialises the NE2000 card and tries to read
the PROM from the card. Please do not run STing or MNet while
performing this test as these would interfere. The PROM holds the MAC
address plus some "signature" bytes specific for a NE2000 or NE1000
card or to the card manufacturer.


Testing the functionality of the NE2000 card i.e. sending and 
receivin EThernet pakets *without* STing or MNet IP stack shall be 
performed by

- HT3ENE*.TOS (see also source HT3ENE.S)

This needs fixing.
